  ["2000 SUPERCHARGED V8 SS BULLET ROADSTER

In 2000, BULLET CARS, moved away from using the Mazda Mx5 and designed a new hand built wide bodied roadster. This car was fabricated from the space frame chassis, up. Composite fibre panels, flared guards & body styling, 1 piece tilt bonnet, speedster cover, SS commodore LSD, Brembos, vinyl roof, immobiliser, specially ordered ROH lightweight race wheels, style bars. The ever reliable Lexus 4 ltr v8 was chosen & rebuilt. The supercharger supplies that even flow of extra grunt. The power to weight ratio is amazing & cruising with the roof down is an added bonus.
I have recently added a new twin system giving a sweet note. Combined with the chargers background whine, as Top Gear would say, what more could you want.

I've found my bullet to be a terrific cruise vehicle and also with conventional boot space, can handle a weeks road trip to Canberra even with the misses mountain of luggage. 

The vehicle has only been serviced by Bulletcars who still operate from their Yatala Qld workshop. They ceased production of the \"BULLET\" years ago and now specialise in superchargers. All mechanical parts are readily available and Bulletcars have retained all body moulds. Their staff are excellent to deal with.

This particular flagship red bullet performed testing for the ADR approvals and also had the honour of gracing the Gold Coast Indy Track in 2008 for the drivers parade lap. Their are no more bullets to be made. You are purchasing 1 of only 24 bullet road cars in existence in the world. This is the only Bullet badged as it is.

This Australian produced muscle car roadster is a truly unique collectors car. It comes with personalised plates \"IMA 303\" and has low Km's.

The RED BULLET is a head turner and exhilarating to drive . Originally marketed at $110 000, this one is a great buy for the enthusiast at $60 000 o.n.o. Overseas move forces the sale of this much cherished convertible.

Only serious enquiries please."
   "BULLET NO 5 AUSTRALIAN DESIGNED AUSTRALIAN BUILT V8 SUPERCAR. NOW WITH FACTORY FITTED AIR- CON BULLET NO 5 AUSTRALIAN DESIGNED AUSTRALIAN BUILT . 
Hand built for a special order by it 's owner the late George Kovacic, 
this bullet roadster has the special distinction of being the very first V8
powered aussie built supercar to emerge from the small chinderah 
factory back in 1999. This is the very car that started the trend known 
australia wide as an extremely fast and exciting locally produced open 
top sports car.Because the original concept was to use mazda rotary 
engines in these cars ,George Kovacic provided all the running gear for 
his special order by supplying a high performance 4.6 ltr super 
lightweight all alloy fuel injected rover V8 crate motor, a tremac 5 speed 
manual transmission and an SS commodore differential. Brakes and 
suspension were standard mazda RX7 as in all bullet supercars.When 
completed this car so impressed its manufactures that more bullet 
roadsters with this Rover V8 power plant were planned but TVR, the 
builders of this Rover V8 ,increased the purchase price, so other power 
options became necessary. POTENTIAL BUYERS PLEASE NOTE. THIS IS THE FASTEST CAR OFF THE LINE THAT I HAVE EVER BEEN IN. EVEN FROM A ROLLING START IT WILL BREAK TRACTION EASILY WITH TOO MUCH THROTTLE. OBVIOUSLY THE POWER TO WEIGHT RATIO HAS PLENTY TO DO WITH THIS BUT THIS CAR IS NOT FOR THE FAINT HEARTED. IT WILL PIN YOU BACK IN THE SEAT AT ANY SPEED WAY ABOVE THE LEGAL LIMIT. If you share my passion for motor cars and would like to own a car with great heritage, a car which is still new with LESS THAN 19,000 KLMS ON THE CLOCK, A car that is extremely fast, robust and easily maintained, then talk to me and you could purchase something that no one else in the world will own. NOW THATS WHAT I CALL A UNIQUE CAR."])
